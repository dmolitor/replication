This folder contains replication code for "What is Your Estimand? Defining the Target Quantity Connects Statistical Evidence to Theory" by Ian Lundberg, Rebecca Johnson, and Brandon Stewart.  All materials are contained in estimands.zip. The directory estimands/data/private only contains a readme because the four data files that go in that directory must be downloaded directly from the data providers; the readme provides more information.

The mansucript is a draft in preparation for submission. Once the paper is forthcoming in a journal, we will provide a full replication package on Dataverse.
