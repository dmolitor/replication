This folder contains replication code for "Setting the Target: Precise Estimands and the Gap Between Theory and Empirics" by Ian Lundberg, Rebecca Johnson, and Brandon Stewart.  All materials are contained in estimands.zip. The directory estimands/data/private only contains a readme because the four data files that go in that directory must be downloaded directly from the data providers; the readme provides more information.

The mansucript is a draft in preparation for submission. Once the paper is forthcoming in a journal, we will provide a full replication package on Dataverse.
