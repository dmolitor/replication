>Lundberg, Ian, Jennie E. Brand, and Nanum Jeon. 2022. "[Researcher reasoning meets computational capacity: Machine learning for social science](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s5zc8)." Working paper.

This replication package reproduces Figures 4, 5, and 6, all of which involve simulated data. The data are generated within the code files.

Each code file can be run independently. The code assumes the following directory structure:
* A main directory, from which R is run
* A code subdirectory, containing the code files
* A figures subdirectory, where output will be placed
* A logs subdirectory, where text output will be placed
