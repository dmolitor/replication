This directory contains replication code for "[The Gap-Closing Estimand: A Causal Approach to Study Interventions that Close Disparities Across Social Categories](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gx4y3)." When the manuscript is accepted for publication, the latest version of these files will be archived on [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ilundberg).

The code uses the [gapclosing package](https://ilundberg.github.io/gapclosing/) (development version 0.0.1.9000). To use the code, you will first need to install the package: <pre>devtools::install_github("ilundberg/gapclosing")</pre>

To replicate the paper using the code in this repository, you will need to retrieve the data files from the websites that administer them. The [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) website requires registration for data access. The code also uses a [crosswalk](https://osf.io/xb2yz/) provided in a GSS methodological memo.
