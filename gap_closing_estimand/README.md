This directory contains replication code for "[The Gap-Closing Estimand: A Causal Approach to Study Interventions that Close Disparities Across Social Categories](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gx4y3)." When the manuscript is accepted for publication, the latest version of these files will be archived on [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ilundberg).

The file simulation.R was run locally. The file class_gap_example.R, which calls gap_estimator.R, was run on a cluster computer. You will need to update the directory structures for your own setup accordingly.

To run the code, you will need to retrieve the data files from the websites that administer them. The [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) website requires registration for data access. The code also uses a [crosswalk](https://osf.io/xb2yz/) provided in a GSS methodological memo.
