# intermediate

The code places intermediate files in this folder. The folder is intentionally empty; it will be populated automatically when you run the replication package. The reason for leaving this directory empty is because in some cases the intermediate files contain microdata, and you need to register with the General Social Survey to use the microdata. See instructions in the [data](https://github.com/ilundberg/replication/tree/master/gap_closing_estimand/data) folder.
