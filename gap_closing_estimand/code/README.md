This directory contains the R scripts of the replication package. To run these scripts, open a terminal window with a working directory one level up from this folder. Then, call the scripts with commands `Rscript code/name_of_file.R`.

* Files A, B, and C must be run sequentially.
* Files D, E, and F can be run independently in any order.
* File G must be run after files A, B, C, D, and F.
* `prepare_environment.R` is called internally by all other scripts.

For more information about the replication package, see the README.md one level up.
